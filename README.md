# phenotype_analysis
Small collection of personal tools and scripts to analyze and visualize phenotypes.

- hypocotyl_analysis.Rmd: R markdown for exploratory data analysis. Investigation of hypocotyl lengths in different genotypes under various light conditions. Input are hypocotyl measurements in long format. Data is visualized as boxplots (with datapoints). Statistical significance is assessed via T-test. Plots are exported as PDF documents.

- hook_analysis.Rmd: R markddown for exploratory data analysis. Investigation of apical hook opening in different genotypes after light exposure. Input are apical hook angle measurements in long format. Data is visualized as lineplot (for time-course) and boxplot (for comparison in darkness, i.e. no light exposure). Statistical significance is assessed via T-test. Plots are exported as PDF documents.
